### What I learned

Build personal portfolio is the last challenge for certification course of [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). I really enjoyed doing this challenge and this is my favourite one. The use of flexbox helped me to make this webpage responsive. I learned how to link section in single webpage, use of ```transition``` property, I also got familiar with differet timing functions.
